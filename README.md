# Landing
For this project I will be recreating the landing page image you will see below: 
![This is an image of what the webpage should model after](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png)


To Replicate this website I will be using the following tools:

- The image provided by The Odin Project
- Google
- CSS
- HTML
- Flexbox

## The Plan
I will begin with the bones of the webpage first to create the layout that I want. From there I will use css and ccs flexbox to style the landing page. 
I do plan on using different color schemes and creating a possible fake company, just to make things more interesting. 
Any images I use that are I do not own I will make sure to site in the contact info section of this README.
